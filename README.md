# Installing

```console
npm install git+ssh://git@github.com/box/box-ts-sdk-generated.git
```

This is autogenerated Box SDK Beta version. The engine used for generating this SDK can be found [here](https://github.com/box/box-codegen).

# Getting Started

To get started with the SDK, get a Developer Token from the Configuration page of your app in the [Box Developer
Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console). You can use this token to make test calls for your own Box account.

The SDK provides an `DeveloperTokenAuth` class, which allows you to authenticate using your Developer Token.
Use instance of `DeveloperTokenAuth` to initialize `Client` object.
Using `Client` object you can access managers, which allow you to perform some operations on your Box account.

The example below demonstrates how to authenticate with Developer Token and print names of all items inside a root folder.

```js
const { Client } = require('BoxSDK/lib/client.generated.js');
const { DeveloperTokenAuth } = require('BoxSDK/lib/developerTokenAuth.js');

async function main(token) {
  let auth = new DeveloperTokenAuth({ token });
  let client = new Client({ auth });
  let entries = (await client.folders.getFolderItems('0')).entries;
  entries.forEach((entry) => console.log(entry));
}

main('INSERT YOUR DEVELOPER TOKEN HERE');
```
