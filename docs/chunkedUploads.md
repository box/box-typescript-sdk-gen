## Create upload session

Creates an upload session for a new file.

This operation is performed by calling function `createFileUploadSession`.

See the endpoint docs at
[API Reference](https://developer.box.com/reference/post-files-upload-sessions/).

<!-- sample post_files_upload_sessions -->

```ts
await client.chunkedUploads.createFileUploadSession({
  fileName: fileName,
  fileSize: fileSize,
  folderId: parentFolderId,
} satisfies CreateFileUploadSessionRequestBody);
```

### Arguments

- requestBody `CreateFileUploadSessionRequestBody`
