### Returns

This function returns a value of type `undefined | ByteStream`.

When a thumbnail can be created the thumbnail data will be
returned in the body of the response.Sometimes generating a thumbnail can take a few seconds. In these
situations the API returns a `Location`-header pointing to a
placeholder graphic for this file type.

The placeholder graphic can be used in a user interface until the
thumbnail generation has completed. The `Retry-After`-header indicates
when to the thumbnail will be ready. At that time, retry this endpoint
to retrieve the thumbnail.
