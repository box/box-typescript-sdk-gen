## Get folder information

Retrieves details for a folder, including the first 100 entries
in the folder.

Passing `sort`, `direction`, `offset`, and `limit`
parameters in query allows you to manage the
list of returned
[folder items](r://folder--full#param-item-collection).

To fetch more items within the folder, use the
[Get items in a folder](e://get-folders-id-items) endpoint.

This operation is performed by calling function `getFolderById`.

See the endpoint docs at
[API Reference](https://developer.box.com/reference/get-folders-id/).

<!-- sample get_folders_id -->

```ts
await client.folders.getFolderById(newFolder.id);
```

### Arguments

- folderId `string`
  - The unique identifier that represent a folder. The ID for any folder can be determined by visiting this folder in the web application and copying the ID from the URL. For example, for the URL `https://*.app.box.com/folder/123` the `folder_id` is `123`. The root folder of a Box account is always represented by the ID `0`. Example: "12345"
- optionalsInput `GetFolderByIdOptionalsInput`
  -

### Returns

This function returns a value of type `FolderFull`.

Returns a folder, including the first 100 entries in the folder.
If you used query parameters like
`sort`, `direction`, `offset`, or `limit`
the _folder items list_ will be affected accordingly.

To fetch more items within the folder, use the
[Get items in a folder](e://get-folders-id-items)) endpoint.

Not all available fields are returned by default. Use the
[fields](#param-fields) query parameter to explicitly request
any specific fields.
