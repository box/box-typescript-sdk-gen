## Upload file version

Update a file's content. For file sizes over 50MB we recommend
using the Chunk Upload APIs.

The `attributes` part of the body must come **before** the
`file` part. Requests that do not follow this format when
uploading the file will receive a HTTP `400` error with a
`metadata_after_file_contents` error code.

This operation is performed by calling function `uploadFileVersion`.

See the endpoint docs at
[API Reference](https://developer.box.com/reference/post-files-id-content/).

<!-- sample post_files_id_content -->

```ts
await client.uploads.uploadFileVersion(file.id, {
  attributes: {
    name: file.name!,
  } satisfies UploadFileVersionRequestBodyAttributesField,
  file: generateByteStream(20),
} satisfies UploadFileVersionRequestBody);
```

### Arguments

- fileId `string`
  - The unique identifier that represents a file. The ID for any file can be determined by visiting a file in the web application and copying the ID from the URL. For example, for the URL `https://*.app.box.com/files/123` the `file_id` is `123`. Example: "12345"
- requestBody `UploadFileVersionRequestBody`
  - Request body of uploadFileVersion method
- optionalsInput `UploadFileVersionOptionalsInput`
  -

### Returns

This function returns a value of type `Files`.

Returns the new file object in a list.

## Preflight check before upload

Performs a check to verify that a file will be accepted by Box
before you upload the entire file.

This operation is performed by calling function `preflightFileUploadCheck`.

See the endpoint docs at
[API Reference](https://developer.box.com/reference/options-files-content/).

_Currently we don't have an example for calling `preflightFileUploadCheck` in integration tests_

### Arguments

- requestBody `PreflightFileUploadCheckRequestBody`
  - Request body of preflightFileUploadCheck method
- headersInput `PreflightFileUploadCheckHeadersInput`
  - Headers of preflightFileUploadCheck method
- cancellationToken `undefined | CancellationToken`
  - Token used for request cancellation.

### Returns

This function returns a value of type `UploadUrl`.

If the check passed, the response will include a session URL that
can be used to upload the file to.

## Upload file

Uploads a small file to Box. For file sizes over 50MB we recommend
using the Chunk Upload APIs.

The `attributes` part of the body must come **before** the
`file` part. Requests that do not follow this format when
uploading the file will receive a HTTP `400` error with a
`metadata_after_file_contents` error code.

This operation is performed by calling function `uploadFile`.

See the endpoint docs at
[API Reference](https://developer.box.com/reference/post-files-content/).

<!-- sample post_files_content -->

```ts
await parentClient.uploads.uploadFile({
  attributes: {
    name: getUuid(),
    parent: { id: '0' } satisfies UploadFileRequestBodyAttributesParentField,
  } satisfies UploadFileRequestBodyAttributesField,
  file: generateByteStream(1024 * 1024),
} satisfies UploadFileRequestBody);
```

### Arguments

- requestBody `UploadFileRequestBody`
  - Request body of uploadFile method
- optionalsInput `UploadFileOptionalsInput`
  -

### Returns

This function returns a value of type `Files`.

Returns the new file object in a list.
