## Upload a File

To upload a small file from a readable stream, call `uploadFile` method. This method returns a `Files` object which contains information about the uploaded files.

<!-- sample post_files_content -->

```js
const fs = require('fs');

const attrs = { name: 'filename.txt', parent: { id: '0' } };
const body = {
  attributes: attrs,
  file: fs.createReadStream('filename.txt'),
};
const files = await client.uploads.uploadFile(body);
const file = files.entries[0];
console.log(`File uploaded with id ${file.id}, name ${file.name}`);
```
