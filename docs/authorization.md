# AuthorizationManager

- [Authorize user](#authorize-user)

## Authorize user

Authorize a user by sending them through the [Box](https://box.com)
website and request their permission to act on their behalf.

This is the first step when authenticating a user using
OAuth 2.0. To request a user's authorization to use the Box APIs
on their behalf you will need to send a user to the URL with this
format.

This operation is performed by calling function `getAuthorize`.

See the endpoint docs at
[API Reference](https://developer.box.com/reference/get-authorize/).

_Currently we don't have an example for calling `getAuthorize` in integration tests_

### Arguments

- queryParams `GetAuthorizeQueryParamsArg`
  - Query parameters of getAuthorize method
- headers `GetAuthorizeHeadersArg`
  - Headers of getAuthorize method
- cancellationToken `undefined | CancellationToken`
  - Token used for request cancellation.

### Returns

This function returns a value of type `undefined`.

Does not return any data, but rather should be used in the browser.
