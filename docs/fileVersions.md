```ts
await client.fileVersions.getFileVersions(file.id);
```

### Arguments

## Promote file version

Promote a specific version of a file.

If previous versions exist, this method can be used to
promote one of the older versions to the top of the version history.

This creates a new copy of the old version and puts it at the
top of the versions history. The file will have the exact same contents
as the older version, with the the same hash digest, `etag`, and
name as the original.

Other properties such as comments do not get updated to their
former values.
